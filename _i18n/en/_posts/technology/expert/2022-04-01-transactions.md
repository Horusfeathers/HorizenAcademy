Digital money would be useless if there was no way to transfer it. Fortunately, there are many advanced techniques that allow the transfer of value with different properties.We examine the two most common accounting techniques used in blockchain in order to understand these transaction mechanisms. These techniques are the UTXO and the Account Model. Afterward, we look at two types of transactions: cross-chain transactions between different interoperable blockchains and state- and payment- channels.

            In order for people to transfer money, we need the concept of an "account balance". We compare two different accounting methods in this article.

           There are different ways to make blockchains interoperable. The Horizen protocol allows the deployment of sidechains. Sidechains are independent domain-specific blockchains that can interact with the Horizen mainchain. Cross-chain transfers enable the transfer of assets from the mainchain to a sidechain and back.

            Blockchains are very secure, but not very efficient or fast. Different scaling solutions are in development in order to enable the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies as a payment method. A very promising approach is to create second-layer solutions using a technology called state- and payment- channels. We look at how this technology works in this article.
